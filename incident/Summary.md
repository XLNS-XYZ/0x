Complicated Circumstances.
-------
I made this post because explaining everything at once would be so confusing and complicated, take your time reading it.
 I try my best to maintain a neutral amd formal tone here.
 
My Mac-book was running through a few issues. And that, I **believed** performance was bad, resembling the general losses when playing with me.

Due to the team failing alongside during the operations, the squad decided to 'have fun' and play around.

I was quite moved about the approach to the situation, so I added a comment stating that the actions would be unreasonable and inappropriate. I used the words ‘Selfish’ and “You don’t care” during the situation and been dismissed by responses mentioning that I was not in the Voice call, implying that I didn’t grasp correctly on the perspective of them inside the voice call.

Because of this response, I was angered by the reputation of the general group; not considering members who are outside of the voice call and not part of the UNI-TE squadron, who are trying to gain a higher score **despite knowing that they have lost** in order to prevent demotion. The general response has been repeated in the past and I have allowed to be tolerant to the situation, or to avoid escalation by muting myself.

Because of the game system, I have been demoted to the lowest level possible achievable in the game. Repeatedly losing due to what I believed were my computer circumstances. I went to the extent where I considered prioritising the possession of a new laptop for this matter.

But to be safe about the thought and situation, I wanted to confirm that it would be my laptop issues or the squad that might’ve caused the demotions in the game, so I decided to play matched with anonymous people.

I had three base matches which summarised my performance without the team:

Despite one loss, I **noticed that my performance has highly improved outside the team**, based on the general average increase in statistics related to my Kill to Death Ratio, I had to raise the issue against the certain squad members. But received inappropriate responses. Furthermore to the issue being raised, a counter-statement was provided that I was a bad leader, and had no relevance to what I was trying to prove in the first place, by changing the topic. This was throughout the whole group because prejudice was built up by discriminating my ability to command the group on the Voice communications alongside with other UNI-TE members. Perspectives were shifted regarding this.

**I want to emphasise, that I could not be on the call because I was busy dealing with my brother who happened to be annoying me at the wrong time.**

Following on the comments regarding my ability, and un-constructive criticism towards my ability as a leader, I thought it would be inevitable that the commanding officer of the group will be shifted towards someone else, and that my continuation and ability to command the unit would be seriously comprimised.

To prevent jeopardisation of my hard-work ( - Creation of the Group Name, Logos, Assets, Rulebooks, Roles, Organisation, System, Control) and credit under someone else. I had to remove the discord (where most of the assets would be contained inside) to refrain them from doing so and re-using the old assets.

I disregard any comments relating to the ‘bullying’ of Matej. I have already had a private conversation (before this incident) with him concerning this as I realised the potential issue I might have caused.
